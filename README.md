# machine-learning-for-Heart-Attack-prediction
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting heart attack risk. Implemented and compared multiple classification algorithms (SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree) to identify the optimal model. Addressed data imbalance through SMOTE and achieved robust classification performance.
