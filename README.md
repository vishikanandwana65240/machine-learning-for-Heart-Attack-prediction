# machine-learning-for-Heart-Attack-prediction
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting heart attack risk. Implemented and compared multiple classification algorithms (SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree) to identify the optimal model. Addressed data imbalance through SMOTE and achieved robust classification performance.

This heart disease dataset is acquired from one o f the multispecialty hospitals in India. Over 14 common features which makes it one of the heart disease dataset available so far for research purposes. This dataset consists of 1000 subjects with 12 features. This dataset will be useful for building a early-stage heart disease detection as well as to generate predictive machine learning models.
